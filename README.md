<h2>ABOUT:</h2>
This is a set of Python scripts and object-oriented classes to allow an iRobot Create 2 to be controlled via a wired or wireless PS3 controller using a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Any wireless controllers should be connected via a 2.4Ghz dongle.

<h2>USAGE:</h2>
No formal installation is needed, simply use the command 
<code>git clone https://github.com/J-Alan-W/acm-piloted-robot</code><br>
to place the code in your desired directory, then create a crontab job to run PilotRobot.py on startup using
<code>crontab -e</code>.<br><br>
The crontab job should look something like this:<br>
<code>@reboot python3 /home/roomba/acm-piloted-robot/PilotRobot.py</code> <br><br>
(Assuming your username is roomba and you place it in the default folder.
Your filepath may vary depending on your username and where you place the folder.)
